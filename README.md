# VARBET: Data Analysis of VAR Impact on Fan Experience and Betting Behaviour

##  Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my Master's Dissertation.

The objective was to analyse how the introduction of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology affects:

- Fan enjoyment
- Perceived fairness
- Match flow and pace
- Betting behaviour trends

The study combines survey data analysis, statistical evaluation, and interactive web-based visualisation.

##  Business Problem

The introduction of VAR has changed the dynamics of professional football.

Stakeholders (clubs, betting companies, broadcasters) need to understand:

- Does VAR improve trust in decision-making?
- Does it reduce enjoyment?
- Does it influence betting frequency?
- How do perceptions differ across age groups?

Understanding this helps drive engagement strategy and monetisation decisions.
